A command line client for interacting with Dungeons bot (@dungeons@mastodon.social). Allows for viewing the current status of the adventure and voting for the current action.

NOT affiliated with Dungeons bot (which is developed/maintained/run by @astrelion@mastodon.social), this is simply for interacting with its public posts from my own personal account without using Mastodon directly.

This has been developed solely for my personal use and for personal development. Source code shared in case anyone is interested.
